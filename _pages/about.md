Hi! I am an incoming CS PhD student at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) and [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu), mentored by Professor [Chen Zhao](http://www.chenz.umiacs.io/). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Data Science (concentration in Artificial Intelligence) from NYU Shanghai, where I was supervised by Professor [Wilson Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam). My research interests are in **Retrieval-Augmented Langauge Models** and **Controllable Text Generation**.
