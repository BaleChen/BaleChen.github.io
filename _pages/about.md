Hi! I am an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. degree in Data Science (concentration in Artificial Intelligence) at [New York University](https://nyu.edu) and [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu). I also have a minor in Computer Science. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at [NYU Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://dail.shanghai.nyu.edu/), mentored by Prof. [Chen Zhao](http://www.chenz.umiacs.io/). Previously, I was supervised by Prof. [Wilson Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam). My current research interest is in **retrieval-augmented language models** and **controllable text generation**, but I am also generally interested in Deep Learning and AI agents.

Feel free to reach out to me through email if you are interested in my projects, research area, or others!
