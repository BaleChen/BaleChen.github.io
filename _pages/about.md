Hi! I am a undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. degree in Data Science (concentration in Artificial Intelligence) at [New York University](https://nyu.edu) and [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu). I also have a minor in Mathematics. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at [NYU Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://dail.shanghai.nyu.edu/), mentored by Prof. [Wilson Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam). My current research interest is in **human-centered large language models** and **NLP alignment**. Specifically, my focus is to develop methods to help large language models learn in a **controllable, robust, and trustworthy** way that benefits users. My current research projects revolves around RLHF and empirical research with generative language models. 

Feel free to reach out to me through email if you are interested in my projects, research area, or others!
