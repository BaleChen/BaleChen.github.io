## AI Interest Group

At NYU Shanghai, I co-founded the AI Interest Group with Margaret Mao, Yuxuan Xia, and Xinqi Zou. We have successfully held many workshops and seminars in Summer 2023. You can find the materials from past events [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zlYKYDaf0lSpnKC3JH_vL7ORAkdoO05X?usp=sharing). We have paused the events in Fall 2023 due to time conflicts and plan to resume in Spring 2023. If you are an NYU student and would like to join our group, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/R5Mvem7j8zm7agva8). If you are outside of NYU-network, feel free to reach out to me through email first.
