*This work was done collaboratively by Bale Chen and Tracy Zhu (2 undergraduates at NYU) and won 6th place among 22 groups of graduate students.*

This is a class-wide Kaggle Competition on Plant Seedling Classification. We experimented with transfer learning, data augmentation, ensemble methods, model scaling and RayTune hyperparameter tuning. Eventually, as two undergraduate students in an advanced graduate-level course, we won the 6th place out of 22 groups.
