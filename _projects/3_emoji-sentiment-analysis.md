Emojis are usually "trashed out" during preprocessing stage of Twitter sentiment analysis. In this research, I probed into how we can incorporate those sentiment-rich emojis to improve sentiment analysis accuracy. I also conducted an experiment on how compatible current BERT-based encoders are with emojis. This work provides insights into how we should process emoji-included data with BERT encoders for the sentiment analysis task.
